1️⃣ Non-Goals / Out of Scope (VERY IMPORTANT)

This prevents feature creep.

Write this explicitly:

    Out of Scope (for MVP):

       • Payments

       • Video calls (Stream.io later)

       • Resume file uploads

       • Ratings / reviews

       • Notifications system

This keeps you focused and sane.
