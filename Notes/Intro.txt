Project: Transparent Hiring Platform (OnlineJobs.ph–Inspired)

A full-stack job marketplace designed to fix critical inefficiencies in traditional job boards.

The platform supports two roles:
Hiring Managers and Applicants, each with a dedicated UI and workflow.

Key innovations:

    Application status tracking — applicants can see whether their application is unread, rejected, shortlisted, or approved

    Interview pipeline — shortlisted applicants can confirm interest and proceed to structured interviews

    Free applicant communication — removes paywalls that prevent fair candidate–employer interaction

    Role-based dashboards with separate authorization logic

Focus: authentication, authorization, state management, REST APIs, and scalable system design
